## What is machine learning pipeline?

A machine learning pipeline is a way to codify and automate the workflow it takes to produce a machine learning model. Machine learning pipelines consist of multiple sequential steps that do everything from data extraction and preprocessing to model training and deployment.


###  machine learning pipeline would consist of the following processes:
	In reality, a machine learning pipeline should resemble more of a cyclical and iterative process. 

cnvrg.io defines the stages of the machine learning pipelines to look more like this:
