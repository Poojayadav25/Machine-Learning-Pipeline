What Is a Machine Learning Pipeline?
A machine learning pipeline is a way to codify and automate the workflow it takes to produce a machine learning model. Machine learning pipelines consist of multiple sequential steps that do everything from data extraction and preprocessing to model training and deployment.
A typical machine learning pipeline would consist of the following processes:
•	Data collection
•	Data cleaning
•	Feature extraction (labelling and dimensionality reduction)
•	Model validation
•	Visualisation
