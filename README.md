# Machine learning pipeline

## What is machine learning pipeline?

A machine learning pipeline is a way to codify and automate the workflow it takes to produce a machine learning model. Machine learning pipelines consist of multiple sequential steps that do everything from data extraction and preprocessing to model training and deployment.


###  machine learning pipeline would consist of the following processes:
	Data collection
    Data cleaning
	Feature extraction (labelling and dimensionality reduction)
	Model validation
	Visualisation
